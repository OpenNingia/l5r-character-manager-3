        <Description>
The Chuda are unparalleled masters of undeath. As a Simple
Action you may expend a spell slot of any element
to immediately create from existing corpses a number of
zombies equal to your Taint Rank. These undead will obey
simple commands from you. They last for one week or
until you choose to dismiss your power over them—either
way, at that point the corpses disintegrate into rot and
dust. (Statistics for zombies can be found on page 331 of
the L5R RPG 4th Edition rulebook.)
