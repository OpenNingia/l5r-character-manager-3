        <Description>
You can sense the presence of dangerous spirits (ghosts,
gaki, yokai, creatures from the spirit realms, etc) by making
an Investigation (Notice) / Perception roll. The base
TN for this roll is 20, but may be increased by the GM for
spirits which are exceptionally diffi cult to notice. You may
make two Raises on the roll to learn the specifi c nature of
the spirit you detect (e.g. a yorei, a gaki, etc).
You may take a Complex Action to attempt an exorcism
on someone who is possessed by a ghost, gaki, oni,
kitsune-tsuki, or similar entity. You expend one spell slot
and make a Contested Willpower roll against the spirit; if
you fi rst place an exorcism ward on the target (see sidebar),
you gain +2k2 on the roll. With a success, you force
the spirit to leave the body it is possessing; it cannot attempt
to re-possess that same person for at least 24 hours.
