      <Tech name="The Art of Mockery" rank="5" id="crane_the_art_of_mockery">
        <Description>
The Kakita Jester is tasked with sardonically puncturing the
pretense and arrogance of court, reminding all present of
their fl awed and mortal natures. You may publicly mock a
suitable target (someone hypocritical, arrogant, dishonorable,
or otherwise deserving of your attention) by means of
speech, dance, song, or other such methods. This requires a
Contested Roll of your [chosen art] / Awareness against the
target’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower. If you lose the roll,
you lose points of Glory equal to the target’s Status Rank. If
you win the roll, the target loses face in public, suffering a
loss of Glory points equal to your Glory Rank, and a loss of
Honor points equal to half as much (rounded up).
You may not target the same person with this Technique
more than once per month.
