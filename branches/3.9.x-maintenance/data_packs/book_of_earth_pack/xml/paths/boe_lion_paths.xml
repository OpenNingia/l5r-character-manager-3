      <Tech name="Broken by Tactics" rank="4" id="broken_by_tactics"><Description>The Akodo family’s mastery of warfare does extend to sieges, and while their expertise in that domain is not 
so great as the Kaiu, they have attacked enough castles 
over the centuries to make it a specific topic of study at the Akodo War College. When you are on the attacking side in a siege, your expertise makes it easier for your side to overcome the castle’s defenses. When rolling on the Mass Battle Table under those circumstances, you always receive a Heroic Opportunity, regardless of the normal result. Any structures on the opposing side suffer a 50% penalty to their Reduction, due to your superior understanding of their weaknesses (this penalty is applied after any defending bonuses to their Reduction).</Description></Tech>
